      "Every recruitment domain runs as its own dedicated app instead of a generic form. The App domain opens inside an App Store clone. Web opens inside a GitHub-styled repo browser. Competitive Coding runs in a LeetCode-style problem view with a Monaco editor. Design opens as a Figma-styled canvas. Research lives inside a Reddit-style subreddit. Management runs as a Discord server with channels and polls.",

      "There's also a FaceTime-style scheduler for interview slots - applicants pick a time and the call card flips like a real ringing call.",
      "Easter eggs are scattered across the entire OS. Hidden apps, hidden dock items, secret terminal commands, secret keyboard shortcuts, and at least one app that only opens if you go looking. The bar set by previous OCS sites has been thoroughly cleared.",
      "Under the hood: Next.js 16 with the App Router on React 19, Prisma 6 talking to CockroachDB, NextAuth v5 for auth, AWS S3 + CloudFront for asset delivery, socket.io for the multiplayer scribble game, the Monaco Editor for the LeetCode app, and a Radix + shadcn/ui + Tailwind base. Window dragging, tiling and resizing are powered by react-rnd, animations by Framer Motion, and the whole thing leans on next-mdx-remote for in-app content.",
