      "inspiHer is ACM-VIT's flagship podcast and speaker series organized under ACM-W (Association for Computing Machinery - Women's Chapter). It was created to showcase the journeys of accomplished women in technology, research, entrepreneurship, design, and STEM, while making these stories accessible to students through candid conversations rather than formal lectures.",
      "The series is built around the idea that seeing successful women in technology discuss their experiences can inspire more students - especially women - to pursue careers in computing and leadership. Each episode explores the speaker's career journey, college experiences, breaking into the tech industry, challenges faced as women in STEM, work-life balance, leadership experiences, building communities, and advice for students.",
      "Unlike a technical workshop where the focus is on learning a technology, inspiHer focuses on the people behind the technology. The conversations are intentionally informal so students can relate to the speaker's experiences. It extends beyond coding into leadership, entrepreneurship, mental health, communication, and personal growth.",
